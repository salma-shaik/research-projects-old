Annual Estimates of the Resident Population by Sex, Age, Race Alone or in Combination, and Hispanic Origin for the United States and States: April 1, 2010 to July 1, 2016

[1] "In combination" means in combination with one or more other races. The sum of the five
race groups adds to more than the total population because individuals may report more than
one race.


Note: The estimates are based on the 2010 Census and reflect changes to the April 1, 2010
population due to the Count Question Resolution program and geographic program revisions.
Median age is calculated based on single year of age. Hispanic origin is considered an
ethnicity, not a race.  Hispanics may be of any race. Responses of "Some Other Race" from the
2010 Census are modified. This results in differences between the population for specific race
categories shown for the 2010 Census population in this table versus those in the original
2010 Census data. For more information, see
